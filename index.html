    <h2>Why Are Glaciers Melting?</h2>

    <p>
        Glaciers are melting mostly as a result of human-induced global warming. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase global temperatures by trapping heat in the atmosphere. 
        As a result, glaciers and ice sheets are losing mass rapidly, leading to rising sea levels and altered ecosystems.
